{"name":"Bitcoin Multi-signature API","tagline":"Sign bitcoin multisig transactions (P2SH spends) from your Coinkite shared accounts, using this simple python program","body":"# Offline Signing Tool (python version)\r\n\r\nThis simple tool can be used to sign a proposed multisig transaction\r\n(P2SH spend). You must already possess the associated extended public key\r\n(BIP32 wallet). The details of the transaction to be signed can\r\neither be fetched from Coinkite (based on a very long URL, provided\r\nwith `--url` argument) or in a file, as downloaded from the site.\r\n\r\nThe signed output (which is a small JSON file) can be uploaded\r\nmanually, but this program will by default upload the file to\r\nCoinkite.  If this new signature is the final one required, the\r\ntransaction is sent immediately.\r\n\r\nThis code is functionally equivalent to the standard Javascript\r\noffline-signing code we provide at: <https://coinkite.com/offline/>\r\n\r\n[Learn more about Coinkite's Multisig (Shared) accounts](https://coinkite.com/faq/multisig)\r\nand visit the [Coinkite Main Site](https://coinkite.com/) to open your\r\naccount today!\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\n![form screenshot](example-form.png \"Example from Coinkite.com\")\r\n\r\nSave the file you get from pressing beside the **Green** arrow, and \r\nprovide that as the `--proposal` argument.
